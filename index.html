  <h1  class="l-t-l" id="learn-how-to-learn">Learn how to learn</h1>
  <div class="l-t-l-div">
 
    <p class="read-more-wrap"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Before improving education in Egypt you must Learn how to learn?
      First we must know what learning means
      Learning is divided into two categories: focused mode & diffused mode. <br>
      <b> Focused mode:</b> occurs when focusing on certain things such as work, integration with the computer, study, and integration with books <br>
     <b> Diffused mode: </b> It occurs when resting and not thinking and releasing ideas linked to each other in the brain and usually good ideas and this situation is repeated before bedtime where the brain connects thoughts to each other.<br>
      <b>II.</b>
      Memory is divided into two categories: short-term and long-term<br>
      <b>Short-term:</b> stores new information but does not maintain it for a long time <br>
     <b> Long term:</b> A large and spacious place that stores information for long periods <br>
      And to convert the memory from short-term to long-term, the information must be repeated more than once, but not at the same time, it is better to be once every day better than to be 100 times a day because the repetition of information to save it increases from the repetition of information every day
      Useful information:  
      <span id="dots">...</span>
      <span id="more">
      The brain contains 73% water, do not forget to drink rejuvenating water
      How do we use memory in a way that uses it correctly?
      The best way is to repeat the information every day but there are other things that can be used for memorization such as
      When you link information with pictures it makes the information saved in memory and also when you talk out loud it stores the information
      <br> ⛔<b>A common mistake  among humans:</b>
      The brain uses only 10% of the brain's capacity. ❌
      The brain uses 100% of the brain's ability ✅, not just  10%<br>
       <b>III.</b> Trying to stay away from procrastination
      We must feel remorse to complete our homework.
      And we should focus on time and not quantity
      And start with the easy work to encourage us to continue
      And also stay away from distractions like phone and games
      Fourth: Shredding Strategy
      Which is to divide the information into things that we understand and that are easy to memorize so that you save the information how much Tips to increase the level of study for students. <br>
      1️⃣ Exercise and physical activity are useful to increase the ability of the mind to think<br>
      2️⃣ Group study seriously is very preferred because explanation and questioning benefit students among each other<br>
      3️⃣ Start with easy questions, but when the exam is never difficult because it increases the level of concentration in the exam<br>
      4️⃣Test yourself in solving problems more than once<br>
      5️⃣ Calm during the exam and stimulate yourself to focus during the exam
      Albert Einstein:
      Once you stop learning, you start dying
